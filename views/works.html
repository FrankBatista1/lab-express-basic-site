  <h3>Stone Sour</h3>
  <p>Taylor is a founding member of American hard rock band Stone Sour. After he formed the band in 1992[16] with drummer Joel Ekman, Shawn Economaki joined filling in the bass position, leaving the electric guitar position to be filled by Josh Rand. Stone Sour recorded a demo album in 1993, and another in 1994. In 1997, Taylor was approached by the metal band, Slipknot, resulting in him abandoning Stone Sour while they were recording a demo album with Sean McMahon at SR studios.[17][18] Taylor did not return until five years later to record their debut album, Stone Sour in 2002. Both Taylor and guitarist Josh Rand contacted Jim Root, Slipknot's guitarist, and Shawn Economaki, Stone Sour's original bassist, to begin writing songs for their debut album.[19] Drummer Joel Ekman came back on board as well.[20][21] This "reformation" later resulted in Stone Sour recording at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa.[20][22]</p>
  <h3>Slipknot</h3>
  <p>In Des Moines, Iowa, Joey Jordison, Shawn Crahan, and Mick Thomson approached him asking him to join Slipknot.[17] He agreed to go to one of their practices, and ended up singing in front of them. Of Slipknot's nine members, Corey was the sixth to join the band. Performing with Slipknot, he would also come to be known as "Number Eight", since the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0â€“8. According to Shawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes infinity.[31]

    Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour, Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour, even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon.[18] Taylor's first gig with Slipknot was on August 24, 1997, which according to band members did not go well. During his first gig, Taylor was performing with facepaint instead of a mask; however, for his second show on September 12, he wore a mask that resembles his debut album mask.[32] Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their second demo album, a self-titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers.[33] As their permanent vocalist, he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California, and released Slipknot, the band's debut album that peaked at number one on the Top Heatseekers chart,[34][35] went double platinum in the United States,[36] and was included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[37] Taylor was accused of copyright infringement regarding the lyrics of the song "Purity", but no action was taken.[38] Taylor began recording for their second studio album, Iowa, in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image in Van Nuys, Los Angeles.[39] It was released August 28, 2001, and peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart,[40] as well as number three on the Billboard 200.[41] While writing Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label.[42] It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.[43] All Hope Is Gone was the first Slipknot album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200.[44]</p>

    Taylor has appeared as a guest musician on albums by Soulfly, Apocalyptica, Damageplan, Steel Panther, and Code Orange. At one point, he was heavily involved in the recording of thrash metal band Anthrax's album, Worship Music, but the sessions remain unreleased.[45] He also contributed to the Roadrunner United all-star album in 2005, providing vocals for the song "Rich Man".[46] Taylor also made a brief appearance in Steel Panther's singles "Death to All but Metal", "Eyes of a Panther", and "Asian Hooker".[47] In 2006, Taylor founded the record company Great Big Mouth Records.[48] Taylor has produced two albums: Facecage's self-titled album and Walls of Jericho's Redemption.[49][50] Taylor provided guest narration on the track "Repentance" for Dream Theater's 2007 album Systematic Chaos. In an interview with Billboard, Taylor confirmed that on January 13, 2009, he was planning on making a solo album, as well as returning to his side project Stone Sour after Slipknot's All Hope Is Gone World Tour.[51] Taylor has stated that he was writing songs that "don't fit either of his main bands."[51] He describes them as a cross between Foo Fighters, Johnny Cash, and Social Distortion, saying that there's "a country background that comes built-in with living in Iowa".[51]
    
    On March 30, 2009, it was confirmed that Taylor and the Junk Beer Kidnap Band would be performing at Rockfest in 2009.[52] The group performed on April 24, 2009, at People's Court in Des Moines, Iowa, marking Taylor's first official solo show.[53] Taylor performs with his band the Dum Fux with Denny Harvey, who make covers for 1970s punk rock and 1980s hair metal.[54] Taylor also performs with Audacious P, a band that is primarily a Tenacious D cover band.[55] Rapper Tech N9ne confirmed that Taylor was to perform on his album K.O.D., but was removed because Taylor did not submit his vocals in time.[56][57] Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the band Velvet Revolver, but said that it just did not work out.[58] However, according to a recent Billboard article, it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver, though no official confirmation has been made.[59] Duff McKagan added that they can neither "confirm or deny" Taylor's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the "real deal".[60] Slash has since ruled Taylor out as the possible new vocalist explaining that "[it] just wasn't right" although he does love him.[61] Taylor has, however, recorded 10 new songs with the band, although drummer Matt Sorum stated it is unlikely they will ever be released.[62] Taylor explained to Mark Hoppus on Hoppus on Music that he and McKagan were writing new music for a possible new supergroup.[63</p>
